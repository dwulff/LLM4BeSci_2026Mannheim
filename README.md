### Before the course

#### Hugging Face and Meta Llama License
1. Make sure you have a Hugging Face account (https://huggingface.co/join).
2. Go to the [`meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct` model page](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct) and fill in the 'COMMUNITY LICENSE AGREEMENT' form at the top of the page to get access to the model (this may take a day or so). 

#### Google Colab and GitHub Repository
3. If you do not have a Google account, you will need to create one (this can be deleted after the workshop).

### During the course
1. Navigate to Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/).
2. In the top-left, click New > More > Colaboratory. If you do not see Colaboratory, you may need to click "Connect more apps", 
search for 'Colaboratory,' and install it. Then click New > More > Colaboratory.
3. Copy the following code snippet into the first cell of the notebook. Run it (```shift + enter``` or click &#9658; button) to mount your Google Drive to the Colab environment.
A pop-up will ask you to connect; click through the steps to connect your Google Drive to Colab (unfortunately, this only works if you give Google full permissions).
```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount("/content/drive")
```
4. Create a second cell in your notebook using the "+ Code" button that appears when you hover your cursor right under the first cell. Copy and run the following code snippet in the second cell of your notebook to clone the GitHub repository to your Google Drive:
```
%cd /content/drive/MyDrive
!git clone https://github.com/dwulff/LLM4BeSci_2025MetaRep
```
5. Go back to your Google Drive and navigate to the folder "dwulff/LLM4BeSci_2025MetaRep" (this is your own copy, so you can edit it how you like, and the changes won't affect anyone else's copies). You should see the directories `day_1`, `day_2`, `day_3` containing the relevant notebooks (.ipynb files) and data (it may take a couple of minutes for the files to appear) for each day's exercises.

You have now successfully set up your Google Colab environment and cloned the GitHub repository! 

You are now ready to work through all the exercises in the course!
